                    <p class="card-text">
                        The Event Management System was founded in 2025 by a group of passionate event planners who saw a need 
                        for a comprehensive yet easy-to-use platform that would take the stress out of event planning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        What started as a simple idea has grown into a platform that helps thousands of organizers create 
                        events and connect with attendees worldwide.
